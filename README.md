# Bottleneck Gallery

Bottleneck Gallery is my final project for the Turing School of Software & Design. The goal of this project was to mimic a take home project, specifically, learning a new piece of technology over a few days, in this case Vue.js. For this project I had to use the Harvard Museum API to create an online Art Gallery.
